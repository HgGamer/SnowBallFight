implement a camera movement where the camera follows the player (transform) keep the rotation of the camera
-------

implement a basic WASD movement, dont need to use gravity, separate the input and movement, movement should be a function with Vector2 paramenter and move based on that
-------

add player and camera rotation when right mouse button is pressed and we move the mouse horisontally rorate camera  and player on Y axis
-------

only the player moves, rotate the camera as well
-------

rotate the camera based on player faceing direction do not user the mouse input
-------

movement should be related to facing direction
-------

\Lib.cs(126,12): error CS1061: 'Local' does not contain a definition for 'Puppet' and no accessible extension method 'Puppet' accepting a first argument of type 'Local' could be found (are
 you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)
------- 
For the code present, we get this error:
```
The type or namespace name 'CinemachineCamera' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.
-------
call this but on main thread
-------
can i call it in the next frame?
-------

Move function should return the move vector in worldspace
-------

transform.position assign attempt for 'Puppet - 1' is not valid. Input position is { NaN, NaN, 0.000000 }.
-------

the lerp is good but when it changes from 360 it rotates in the wrong direction
-------

camera movement should be lerped as well
-------

create snowball
-------

why is my snowball is not moving?
-------

can you explain this part?
-------

calculate direction vector from  player.rotation;
-------

calculate distance from 0,0 and if its larger than 100 delete entinty
-------

if player next position magnitude would be over 20 round it down so its under 20
-------

spawn wall prefabs from center a given distance , and given number of them equaly arranged around the circle each faceing the circle center
-------

implement 
-------

okay schedule snowball spawning after 1sec instead of instantly calling spawn snowball, replace the    Task.Delay call with itu
-------

okay schedule snowball spawning after 1sec instead of instantly calling spawn snowball, replace the  call
-------

based on the direction offset to the right by 0.5f
-------

the entity position
-------

lets create obstacles, we need to define its id (string) collider (box or sphere)  and size (box has vector 2  but sphere has 1) 
also in the init function add obstacles
-------

can see this field in unity inspector
-------

lets create a scriptable object where i can define the "static" prefabs in the following way, each data has a string id and a gameobject reference implement the rightclick menu to create scriptable object and change the dictionarry in the prefamanager to a list of the scriptable object
-------

use obstaclePrefabs instead of static prefabs
-------

get obstacles
-------

check collision with every obstacle if yes return true else return false
-------

implement collision check between player and obstacles
-------

check collision between snowball and the players if a player is hit by a snowball delete the snowball and log the player id
--------

fix this part based on comment
--------

implement player to player collision
--------

obstacle spawning works in editor mode but when i build the game i'm getting this error:
No prefab found for obstacle id: snowman
--------

ObstaclePrefabs: 1
NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object
  at PrefabManager.Awake () [0x0003b] in <f047df9c71e043d3b5dc3199a282b454>:0 
--------

why is it null its set in the editor
--------

also I'M getting this:
Did you #if UNITY_EDITOR a section of your serialized properties in any of your scripts?
--------

it seems like unity doesnt like when a scriptable object contains a prefab reference, can we solve it with adressables?
--------

can you refactor the lib.cs into multiple files and folders so its more readable?
-------
