implement a camera movement where the camera follows the player (transform) keep the rotation of the camera
-------

implement a basic WASD movement, dont need to use gravity, separate the input and movement, movement should be a function with Vector2 paramenter and move based on that
-------

add player and camera rotation when right mouse button is pressed and we move the mouse horisontally rorate camera  and player on Y axis
-------

only the player moves, rotate the camera as well
-------

rotate the camera based on player faceing direction do not user the mouse input
-------

movement should be related to facing direction
-------

\Lib.cs(126,12): error CS1061: 'Local' does not contain a definition for 'Puppet' and no accessible extension method 'Puppet' accepting a first argument of type 'Local' could be found (are
 you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)
------- 
For the code present, we get this error:
```
The type or namespace name 'CinemachineCamera' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.
-------
call this but on main thread
-------
can i call it in the next frame?
-------

Move function should return the move vector in worldspace
-------

transform.position assign attempt for 'Puppet - 1' is not valid. Input position is { NaN, NaN, 0.000000 }.
-------

the lerp is good but when it changes from 360 it rotates in the wrong direction
-------

camera movement should be lerped as well
-------

create snowball
-------

why is my snowball is not moving?
-------

can you explain this part?
-------

calculate direction vector from  player.rotation;
-------

calculate distance from 0,0 and if its larger than 100 delete entinty
-------

if player next position magnitude would be over 20 round it down so its under 20
-------
