# SnowFight Game: Project Manager's Guide

## What's This Game All About?

SnowFight is a fun multiplayer game where players throw snowballs at each other in a winter wonderland! Think of it as a digital snowball fight where friends can play together over the internet. Players can craft snowballs, throw them at opponents, dodge incoming attacks, and navigate around obstacles.

## The Big Picture

This project combines:
- A Unity-based game client (what players see and interact with)
- A backend server that keeps everything in sync
- Real-time networking so players can see each other's actions immediately

## Key Features

### üéÆ Player Experience
- Move around freely in a snow-covered arena
- Craft and throw snowballs
- Hit other players to temporarily freeze them
- Work around obstacles in the environment
- Real-time feedback and smooth gameplay

### üèÜ Game Goals
- Be the most accurate snowball thrower
- Avoid getting hit by other players' snowballs
- Master the art of movement and timing

### üé® Visual Style
- Winter-themed environment
- Cartoon-style characters
- Visual effects for snowball impacts
- Smooth animations for player movement

## How It All Works (Without the Tech Jargon)

### The Client Side (What Players See)
The Unity client handles:
- The game's visuals and sounds
- Processing player input (keyboard/mouse/controller)
- Displaying other players and their actions
- The camera that follows the player
- Visual feedback when actions happen

### The Server Side (Behind the Scenes)
The server is responsible for:
- Making sure everyone plays by the rules
- Tracking where everyone is in the game world
- Handling snowball physics and hits
- Syncing everyone's game state
- Preventing cheating

### How Players Connect
1. Player launches the game
2. Game connects to our server
3. Player chooses a name and enters the arena
4. Server keeps track of everything happening
5. Client shows the player what's happening in real-time
